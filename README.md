# Web Security Academy Auto-Recon (WSAAR)

Auto-Recon script that will help you in the [Burp Suite Certified Practitioner Exam](https://portswigger.net/web-security/certification) or with any [web-security lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-labs).

Wordlists provided in [wordlists](./wordlists/) directory are these provided by **Web Security Academy** here : 

- [Username list](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-usernames)
- [Password list](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-passwords)

## üìñ A bit of story 

I created this tool for personal use, at the beginning of the certification when it was still only 3 hours for 6 challenges, because I was very short of time and I needed a tool that would make me recognize the labs to go faster. 
In **no way** my goal was to make a tool that was going to make me do labs automatically, that's why there is no payload in this script, it's only to save time on the reconnaissance related to labs.

I know, the code of this script is not perfect, as I said before I had made this script quickly as my own, I publish this code hoping to give a starting point to someone to make maybe something cleaner or to have a little tool to help with the reconnaissance. If you want to improve it, don't hesitate [to contribute](https://github.com/Nishacid/WSAAR/pulls)

If you want to know more about this certification and the process, I wrote an article here: https://nishacid.guru/articles/bscp/ .
